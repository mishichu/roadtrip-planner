# Roadtrip Planner
## Uses
The Roadtrip Planner is designed to be a social platform for users to create, edit, and share road trip plans with their friends. Features include:

- Users must create an account so that they may log in to view/edit their information.
- Users can edit their profile (picture and bio) and view their trip plans.
- On profile pages, users can friend and unfriend other users; users can view friends' trips they have been invited to.
- In the trip planning wizard, users can search locations and add location markers to a map.
- Users can attach notes and arrival/departure dates to location markers.
- Users can view roadtrip path drawn by the location markers that have been set and also see the estimated driving time and distance.
- Users can invite friends on their trips, making it viewable to them; friends without an account can be invited via email.
- Users can add some notes for the entire trip (e.g. an itinerary).
- Users can publish their trips, which makes them viewable to invited friends; these trips are still editable.
